**Findings**

When adjusting these two variables, we see that the vacant buildings are concentrated in areas with housing values between $400,000 and $200,000. Toggling to the income measure, the reported buildings cluster in tracts with average estimated household incomes between $250,000 and $750,000. We note that while vacant buildings are more concentrated in tracts with lower average estimated home values, and lower estimated household incomes, there are regions, specifically the far southeast side that have lower average estimated home values and lower estimated household incomes. This suggests that low home values and low household incomes are predicates not determinants of concentrated vacancies.
